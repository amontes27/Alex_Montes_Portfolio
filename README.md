**Highlights of completed data science projects and competitions**

# [Airbnb Machine Learning Classification](https://github.com/amontes27/Airbnb_ML_Classification)
A Python machine learning model that predicts whether Chicago Airbnb listings are above or below the median review score
- Collaborated with 3 classmates to [visualize](Data_Visualization.ipynb), clean ([1](Data_Cleaning_1.ipynb), [2](Data_Cleaning_2.ipynb)), and [model](Model_Tuning_Final.ipynb) the data and develop a [report](Airbnb%20Machine%20Learning%20Project%20Report.pdf) detailing our process and findings
 - Performed feature engineering and selection based on exploratory data analysis and model feature importances
 - Tuned a variety of machine learning models (bagging, random forest, boosting) to construct a hard voting ensemble model that maximized accuracy (76.5%) and precision (73.8%) scores on test data
 
 # [Bank Load Repayment Competitions](https://github.com/amontes27/Loan_Competition)
Submissions to 2 Kaggle competitions using Python machine learning models to predict and classify bank loan repayments
- Performed feature engineering and selection using summary statistics, visualizations, and model feature importances
- Tuned MARS, decision tree, and boosted models to generate regression and classification ensembles
- Placed 12th and 34th of 178 participants in the regression and classification components, respectively

# [F1 Data Visualization](https://github.com/amontes27/F1_Data_Visualization)
Plots and a poster presentation created in R that tell the story of a Formula 1 dataset
- Filtered, joined, and manipulated the data to generate insights
- Utilized the ggplot2 package to create bar, box, and line plots based on the analysis (see [plots.R](final_project_code/plots.R))
- Designed a poster presentation using the posterdown package to display plots alongside further analysis and background information (see [poster.Rmd](final_project_code/poster/poster.Rmd) and [Data Visualization Final Poster.pdf](Data%20Visualization%20Final%20Poster.pdf))
